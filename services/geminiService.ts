> *Note: Real AI analysis is disabled because the API Key is missing in your .env file. Here is a simulation based on your local data:*

**1. Monthly Summary**
You have tracked **${transactions.length} transactions** so far. Your total expenses currently sit at **$${totalSpent.toFixed(2)}**. 

**2. Top Spending Category**
Your spending is highest in **${topCatName}**. ${topCatName === Category.FOOD ? 'Dining out is often the easiest place to cut back!' : 'Check if these are fixed or variable costs.'}

**3. Projection**
*Linear Projection:* Based on your current activity, you are on track to stay within a standard budget, provided no large unexpected expenses occur.

**4. Savings Tip**
Try the "30-day rule": wait 30 days before making any non-essential purchase over $50. It helps reduce impulse buying significantly.`;
